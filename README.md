# Machine Learning with TensorFlow

### First things First
### import tesnorflow as tf

## tf.Overview
Welcome to my project repository where I am documenting my journey through machine learning using TensorFlow. This project is a practical, code-based approach to learning machine learning, and I'm using [AI and Machine Learning for Coders](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-and-machine/9781492078180/) as my primary guide.

Book Recommended by - TensforFlow [Official Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/learn-ml/basics-of-machine-learning).
## tf.Project Structure
Each chapter of the book comes with its own set of exercises and code examples. I've organized this repository to mirror the structure of the book. For every chapter, there's a corresponding directory where I implement the concepts and exercises discussed.

## tf.Goals
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts.
- Gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow.
- Share my learning progress and receive feedback.

## tf.How to Navigate This Repository
- Each directory corresponds to a chapter in the book.
- Inside each directory, you'll find the code I've written while working through the chapter.
- Feel free to explore these directories to see my progress and the specific machine learning concepts I've been working on.

## tf.Collaboration and Feedback
I'm always open to collaboration and would greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or help from the community. If you have any recommendations or if you find an issue in the code, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## tf.Staying Updated
I regularly update this repository as I progress through the book. Keep an eye on this space to see my latest work.

## tf.Contact
If you'd like to reach out to me directly, please [Email](vinthagunasekhar@gmail.com) me.

Thank you for visiting my learning journey with TensorFlow and machine learning!
